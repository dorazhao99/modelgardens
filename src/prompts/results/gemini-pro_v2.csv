Reviewer Persona Simulator,"LLM prompt pack that, given the reviews and rebuttal draft, generates probable follow-up questions, score changes, and meta-review commentary from each reviewer role. Includes a ‘stress test’ slider to vary strictness.",,,,,
Priority Drag-Sorter,"Within the synthesis canvas, each theme bar has a drag handle and a numeric priority score. Rearranging themes automatically re-numbers them and updates cross-references in the rebuttal draft.",,,,,
Rebuttal Strategy Board,"A visual, Kanban-style interface where each major theme from the review synthesis is a card. Dora can drag and drop these cards into columns like 'High Priority,' 'Medium Priority,' and 'Low Priority.' Each card can contain the relevant review snippets and her draft responses, making it easy to visually organize the rebuttal's structure.",,,,,
Deadline and Task Tracker,"A simple widget that extracts the rebuttal due date and displays a countdown timer. [24] It would also allow Dora to create a checklist of sub-tasks (e.g., 'Synthesize reviews,' 'Draft rebuttal,' 'Get feedback') with their own deadlines. The widget could sync with a personal calendar like Google Calendar or Outlook.",,,,,
Federated Academic Search,"This widget provides a single search interface that simultaneously queries multiple academic databases like Google Scholar, ACM Digital Library, and Semantic Scholar. [3] It would include specialized filters for conference proceedings, publication year, and keywords. The tool would also help de-duplicate results from the different sources.",,,,,
Citation Helper,"While writing the rebuttal, Dora can highlight a claim she's making. This tool would then take that highlighted text and suggest relevant papers to cite from academic search engines. [11] It would be more targeted than a full search, focusing on providing evidence for specific points.",,,,,
Literature Auto-Scout,"Inside the rebuttal doc, Dora can highlight a claim and click ‘Find Support’. The widget queries Google Scholar, ACM DL, and Semantic Scholar APIs, returning ranked, venue-filtered citations with auto-formatted BibTeX and one-sentence rationales.",,,,,
Paper Cross-Referencer,"A widget where Dora can upload the PDF of her original submission. When drafting the rebuttal, she can type a query like, 'What did I say about the sociotechnical aspects?' The tool would then perform a semantic search on her own paper and pull up the relevant sections, paragraphs, or figures.",,,,,
Politeness & Sentiment Checker,"Runs a sentiment analysis and academic politeness model on the draft, flagging any potentially abrasive or weakly-hedged phrases and suggesting alternatives consistent with venue norms.",,,,,
Tone and Politeness Analyzer,"This tool analyzes the text of the rebuttal and provides feedback on its tone. It would flag sentences that might be perceived by reviewers as overly defensive, dismissive, or arrogant. The tool would suggest alternative phrasing to maintain a professional and respectful tone while still being assertive.",,,,,
Final Polish Assistant,"An AI-powered writing assistant focused on academic style and clarity. [4] Unlike a basic grammar checker, it would be trained on successful academic papers to suggest improvements for flow, transition sentences, and word choice appropriate for a formal rebuttal. It would help with the final polishing described in step 16.",,,,,
Rebuttal Word Count Manager,"This tool helps shorten a rebuttal to meet strict length requirements. It goes beyond a simple word count by highlighting verbose phrases, passive voice, and redundant sentences. It can suggest more concise alternatives and has a target word count feature to guide the editing process.",,,,,
Rebuttal Argument Generator,"This AI tool helps brainstorm responses to tricky reviewer comments. [12, 14, 16] Dora inputs a specific critique from a reviewer, and the tool generates several potential counterarguments or response strategies. It could suggest ways to frame a limitation as a scope choice or propose alternative experiments to promise.",,,,,
Panel Simulation,"An advanced AI tool that extends the 'Reviewer Persona Simulator.' After simulating each reviewer's response to the rebuttal, this tool would then simulate the meta-reviewer's (1AC's) final decision-making process. It would model how the meta-reviewer might weigh the updated opinions of the other reviewers and predict a final score and summary.",,,,,
Plain Text Formatter,A simple utility that strips all formatting from the final Google Docs rebuttal and converts it to clean plain text. It would ensure that no stray formatting characters (like smart quotes or special bullets) cause issues when pasting into a simple textbox in a conference submission system.,,,,,
Rebuttal Word-Budget Heatmap,"Colors sentences based on their contribution to total word count (e.g., dark red = bulky). Hovering suggests concise rewrites. A sidebar ranks longest sentences and paragraphs for easy pruning.",,,,,
Rebuttal Skeleton Generator,"Reads the finalized synthesis canvas and produces a draft rebuttal outline: gratitude sentence, then one section per theme with reviewer citations, proposed response, and promised changes already filled in. Dora can choose ACM or IEEE formatting.",,,,,
