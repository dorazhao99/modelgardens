A floating button in Gmail lets Dora choose an existing doc or create a new one in Drive in one click.", "reasoning": "Automates steps 1 and 4 so Dora doesn’t have to copy-paste long emails by hand and avoids formatting mistakes." }, { "name": "Rebuttal Requirement HUD", "tool": "A sidebar widget that parses the CFP paragraph (length limit, due date/time, character counts, submission URL) and pins that information in any Google Doc Dora is editing. It shows a live countdown and an always-visible word/character counter that turns red when over limit.", "reasoning": "Keeps critical constraints from step 2 and step 19 in constant view, preventing missed deadlines or word-limit overruns." }, { "name": "Example Rebuttal Quick-Look Library", "tool": "Searchable gallery of past accepted rebuttals (PDF/Docs) searchable by venue and year. Hovering shows a side-by-side diff between review excerpts and the authored response so Dora can copy rhetorical structures.

Dora can choose ACM or IEEE formatting.", "reasoning": "Accelerates step 11 by turning the structured notes into prose scaffolding." }, { "name": "Literature Auto-Scout", "tool": "Inside the rebuttal doc, Dora can highlight a claim and click ‘Find Support’.
