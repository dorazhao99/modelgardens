0,Review Synthesizer,"Parses all reviews using NLP to automatically extract key points (e.g., criticisms, questions, suggestions). It then groups similar or related points from different reviewers together, presenting them as a consolidated list. Each point is linked back to its original source in the reviews.","This tool automates the tedious and error-prone task of manually collating feedback. Dora's next step after reading scores is to understand and organize the reviews; this tool directly supports that synthesis action, helping her quickly see the most salient and repeated feedback.",0
1,Rebuttal Strategy Canvas,"Provides an interactive canvas where each synthesized reviewer point is a draggable card. Dora can drag these cards into columns like 'Agree & Fix', 'Respectfully Disagree', 'Clarify Misunderstanding', or 'Acknowledge & Defer'. She can add notes and assign priority levels to each card.","After synthesizing reviews, Dora must strategize her response. This tool transforms that abstract mental process into a structured, visual plan, helping her build a coherent and strategic argument for the rebuttal.",0
2,Context-Aware Rebuttal Editor,"A split-pane writing interface. The left pane displays a specific reviewer comment or a synthesized point. The right pane is a text editor for writing the response to that specific point. It integrates with her submitted PDF, allowing her to link her response to specific pages or sections of her paper.","This tool will help Dora draft the rebuttal efficiently by keeping the context (the review and the paper) visible, reducing the cognitive load of switching between multiple documents. It directly supports the predicted action of drafting the rebuttal document.",0
3,Argument Contradiction Detector,"Analyzes the text across all reviews to specifically flag contradictory suggestions or assessments. For example, it would highlight if Reviewer 1 requests an additional user study while Reviewer 2 praises the current evaluation as sufficient.","Identifying conflicting advice is a critical part of rebuttal strategy. This tool automates that detection, allowing Dora to strategically address the disagreement between reviewers in her response, which is a common and high-impact rebuttal technique.",0
4,Rebuttal Tone Analyzer,"Provides real-time feedback on the tone of Dora's written rebuttal. It checks for defensiveness, overly aggressive language, or dismissiveness and suggests alternative, more professional phrasing. It also provides a summary of the perceived tone of each reviewer.","The rebuttal process is emotionally charged, and it's easy to sound defensive. This tool acts as a safeguard, helping Dora craft a response that is persuasive and respectful, increasing the chances of a positive outcome.",0
5,Character Budget Manager,"Dora inputs the total character limit for the rebuttal. She can then allocate a 'character budget' to each point she plans to address. The tool provides a visual indicator showing how much of the budget each response is using, helping her write concisely and prioritize space.","Rebuttals have notoriously strict length limits, forcing authors to make hard choices. This tool will help Dora manage this constraint strategically, ensuring she allocates enough space to the most critical points instead of running out of room.",0
6,Collaborative Rebuttal Hub,"A shared web-based environment where Dora and her co-authors can view the synthesized reviews. Team members can be assigned to draft responses to specific points, leave comments, and vote on strategic choices within the Rebuttal Strategy Canvas.","Academic writing is often collaborative. This tool streamlines the high-pressure, time-sensitive process of co-authoring a rebuttal, moving beyond messy email chains and providing a single source of truth for strategy and drafting.",0
7,Citation & Evidence Scout,"Allows Dora to highlight a claim or a paper mentioned in a review (e.g., 'The authors miss the work of Smith et al.'). The tool then automatically searches academic databases (like Google Scholar, ACM DL) to fetch the abstract, citation data, and PDF of the mentioned work.",This tool will help Dora quickly verify reviewer claims and find evidence for her counter-arguments. It supports the predicted action of fact-checking and cross-referencing by integrating the literature search directly into the rebuttal workflow.,0
8,Revision Task List Generator,"As Dora writes the rebuttal, she can tag statements like 'We will add this analysis to the final version.' The tool automatically collects these promises into a checklist of tasks for the camera-ready version of the paper, linking each task back to the relevant reviewer comment.","A rebuttal often contains promises for future revisions. This tool helps Dora track these commitments, ensuring that if the paper is accepted, she has a clear, pre-made to-do list for preparing the final version, preventing anything from being forgotten.",0
9,Successful Rebuttal Library,"Analyzes the text of a reviewer's criticism and searches a database of publicly available rebuttals (e.g., from OpenReview.net) from the same conference (UIST). It then surfaces examples of how other authors have successfully structured responses to similar types of critiques.","Dora needs to formulate a persuasive argument. This tool provides inspiration and strategic insight by showing her concrete examples of what has worked for others in the same high-stakes situation, helping her learn from the community's collective experience.",0
10,Rebuttal Project Planner,"Takes the submission deadline and number of major review points as input. It then automatically generates a suggested day-by-day project schedule with milestones (e.g., 'Review Analysis & Strategy,' 'Drafting Responses,' 'Co-author Review,' 'Final Polish & Submission'). The schedule can be exported to calendar applications like Google Calendar or Outlook.","After checking the deadline, Dora's immediate next step is to plan how to use the available time. This tool automates the creation of an actionable timeline, directly addressing the time management and planning phase she is about to enter.",1
11,Review-to-Paper Mapper,"Provides an interactive view of Dora's submitted PDF. When she highlights a specific comment from a review, the tool uses semantic search to identify and display the most relevant paragraphs or figures in her paper that the comment is likely referring to. She can then confirm the link to establish a clear connection.","To effectively rebut a point, Dora must first understand its context within her own work. This tool will help her next action of deep-reading the reviews by automating the process of locating the specific part of her paper being critiqued, saving time and preventing misinterpretation.",1
12,Impact vs. Effort Matrix,"A visual 2x2 grid with 'Effort to Address' on the x-axis and 'Potential Impact on Score' on the y-axis. Dora can drag synthesized reviewer points into one of the four quadrants (e.g., 'High-Impact, Low-Effort'). This helps visually prioritize which issues to tackle in the limited rebuttal space.","After reading the reviews, Dora will need to strategize which points to address. This tool provides a structured framework for this decision-making process, moving beyond simple categorization to a cost-benefit analysis that directly informs her rebuttal strategy.",1
13,Reviewer Persona Profiler,"Analyzes the language, tone, and cited works within each review to generate a speculative profile of the reviewer's priorities. It might tag a reviewer as 'Theory-Focused,' 'Implementation-Oriented,' or 'UX-centric,' helping Dora understand the lens through which her work was judged.","This tool helps Dora tailor her arguments by providing insight into each reviewer's likely expertise and values. This moves beyond the raw text of the review to help her craft a more persuasive and targeted response, a key part of the deep analysis she is about to perform.",1
14,Rebuttal Opening Statement Generator,"After Dora has categorized the main reviewer concerns, this tool generates several template opening paragraphs for the rebuttal. These drafts frame the response positively, thank the reviewers, and concisely summarize the key points that will be addressed, providing a strong starting point for the writing process.","Starting the rebuttal is often a point of friction. This tool helps Dora move from the planning stage to the writing stage by providing well-structured, professional opening statements that set a collaborative tone and outline her response.",1
15,Visual Argument Sketchpad,"A simple digital whiteboard integrated into the rebuttal editor. It allows Dora to quickly sketch diagrams, flowcharts, or annotate figures to create visual explanations. This is especially useful for responding to critiques about complex architectures or processes when character count is limited.","Some critiques are best addressed visually. As Dora analyzes the reviews, she might realize a textual explanation is inefficient. This tool empowers her to create visual aids directly within her rebuttal workflow, a powerful option when constrained by character limits.",1
16,Acronym & Jargon Buster,"Scans all reviews and cross-references the terminology with Dora's submitted paper. It flags acronyms or domain-specific jargon used by reviewers that are not defined in her paper (or vice-versa), identifying potential sources of miscommunication.","Misunderstanding often stems from terminology differences. This tool helps Dora perform a deep-dive analysis by proactively identifying these linguistic gaps, allowing her to address misunderstandings before they derail her rebuttal.",1
17,Expertise-Based Task Assigner,"In a collaborative project, co-authors can link their academic profiles (e.g., Google Scholar). The tool analyzes their publication history and then suggests which co-author is best suited to draft the response for each specific reviewer comment based on their expertise.","After an initial pass of the reviews, the next step is often to delegate. This tool automates and optimizes delegation by using data to match the most qualified author to each point, improving the quality and efficiency of a collaborative rebuttal.",1
18,Conciseness Engine,"Dora can write a detailed, long-form response to a point. This tool then uses generative AI to produce several alternative phrasings that convey the same core message but with a significantly lower character count. Dora can choose the best option that fits her character budget.","Dora just checked the length constraints and will inevitably struggle to be concise. This tool directly assists in the writing and editing phase by automating the difficult task of shortening text while preserving its meaning, ensuring she can address more points effectively.",1
19,What-If Rebuttal Simulator,"Using a model trained on past decisions from the conference, this tool provides a speculative forecast of a rebuttal's success. Dora inputs her strategy (e.g., 'Address R1's major flaw, clarify R2's misunderstanding'), and the tool estimates the probabilistic impact on the final scores.","Dora's first action was to check scores, indicating her anxiety about the outcome. This tool allows her to game-plan different rebuttal strategies during her planning phase and see a simulated result, helping her make more confident strategic choices.",1
20,Example Deconstructor,"A browser extension that, when activated on the example Google Doc, uses NLP to analyze and overlay annotations on the document. It identifies and tags key rhetorical strategies (e.g., 'Acknowledging a Flaw,' 'Correcting a Misunderstanding,' 'Promising a Future Fix'), highlights the overall structure (e.g., 'Opening Summary,' 'Response to Reviewer X'), and detects the tone of each section. This allows Dora to understand not just what the example says, but how it functions as a persuasive document.","Dora is currently studying an example to learn how to structure her rebuttal. This tool accelerates her learning by explicitly breaking down the example's effective components, helping her move from passively reading to actively analyzing its structure and strategies, which is her immediate next step.",2
21,Structural Template Cloner,"A tool that scans the provided example Google Doc ('Memes CSCW review synthesis') and automatically generates a new, blank Google Doc in Dora's own drive that replicates its structure. It copies the exact hierarchy of headings, bullet points, and placeholder sections (e.g., 'Summary of Changes,' 'Response to Reviewer 1'), creating a ready-to-use scaffold for her own rebuttal.","Dora's next action after analyzing the example will be to create her own synthesis document. This tool automates the tedious setup process, allowing her to immediately start inputting her own review points into a format she has just identified as a successful model.",2
22,Dual-View Synthesis Workspace,"A split-screen web application. On the left, it displays the example Google Doc she is studying. On the right, it displays the synthesized review points from the 'Review Synthesizer' tool. Dora can highlight a strategic response in the example doc and 'link' it to one of her own review points, creating a direct association between the example's strategy and her specific problem.","Dora needs to bridge the gap between the example and her own specific reviews. This tool facilitates the direct application of her learnings from the example document to her own work, which is the crucial step between analysis and drafting.",2
23,Implied Workload Analyzer,"This tool analyzes the text of the example rebuttal synthesis ('Memes CSCW review synthesis') to identify and extract all the 'promises' of future work (e.g., 'we will add a new analysis,' 'we will revise Figure 3,' 'we will run a follow-up study'). It then categorizes these promises by estimated effort (Low, Medium, High) to give Dora a realistic preview of the workload associated with a successful rebuttal in this domain.","While studying the example, Dora needs to gauge the scope of work required for a successful revision. This tool provides an immediate estimate, helping her strategize which points she can realistically promise to fix within her own project's constraints.",2
24,Conference Norms Calibrator,"Given that the example is for CSCW and Dora's submission is for UIST, this tool compares the example rebuttal against a database of successful UIST rebuttals. It generates a short report highlighting key differences in style, such as typical response length, level of formality, and common argumentative structures favored by the UIST community, ensuring the example's lessons are adapted correctly.","Dora is using a cross-domain example, which might not perfectly align with the expectations of her target conference (UIST). This tool helps her calibrate her strategy based on the specific norms of her venue, preventing a potential mismatch in her rebuttal's style and focus.",2
25,GDoc Rebuttal Scaffolder,"An add-on for Google Docs that takes the output of the 'Review Synthesizer' and the structural model from the example document. It automatically generates a new, richly formatted Google Doc containing each synthesized review point, pre-populates comment threads for each point (@-mentioning co-authors), and inserts placeholder sections for drafting responses, turning a blank page into a collaborative project plan.","Dora's next step involves creating a document to work on the rebuttal, likely with collaborators. This tool anticipates the need for a structured, collaboration-ready document and automates its creation, merging the synthesis and planning phases.",2
26,Live Paper Linker,"A Google Docs Add-on for Dora's new synthesis document.

Hovering over this link within the Google Doc will display a thumbnail preview of the corresponding page or section from her paper, keeping the context readily available without switching tabs.","As Dora synthesizes reviews based on the example, she will constantly need to refer back to her own paper. This tool integrates that reference material directly into her new working document, streamlining the process of connecting reviewer feedback to the source material.",2
27,Argument Flow Visualizer,"This tool ingests the example Google Doc and generates a visual flowchart of its argument structure. It maps out the logical flow, showing how the authors move from an overall summary to addressing major critiques and then minor points. This provides Dora with a high-level blueprint of a successful rebuttal's narrative arc.","Dora is looking at an example to understand its structure, but a linear document can hide the underlying logical flow. This tool extracts that flow into a visual map, giving her a strategic blueprint to follow as she begins to structure her own rebuttal argument.",2
28,Key Phrase Library,"A tool that scans the example rebuttal and other successful rebuttals from the 'Successful Rebuttal Library'. It extracts and categorizes powerful and professional phrases used for different situations (e.g., phrases for disagreeing politely, for accepting criticism gracefully, for clarifying a technical point). This library can be accessed from within her rebuttal editor, allowing her to easily insert effective, pre-vetted language.","After analyzing the example, Dora will start writing. This tool provides her with a palette of effective language, solving the 'blank page' problem and helping her adopt the appropriate tone and rhetorical style learned from the examples.",2
29,Synthesis-to-Draft Initiator,"After Dora has created her own synthesis document modeled on the example, this tool reads each synthesized point and the original reviewer comment. It then uses a generative AI to produce a concise, well-structured first-draft response for each point, framed in a professional tone. This provides a starting point for each response that Dora and her team can then refine.","The most logical step after synthesis is drafting responses. This tool directly supports that action by converting the structured synthesis into initial prose, significantly reducing the activation energy required to begin writing the rebuttal.",2
30,GDoc Review Parser & Organizer,"A Google Docs Add-on that parses the raw, pasted review text within the current document. It automatically identifies the boundaries of each review (e.g., '--- Review 1 ---', '--- Review 2 ---') and restructures the document by creating formal headings for each reviewer. It then further parses each review, identifying and separating distinct points (e.g., numbered lists, distinct paragraphs of criticism) into sub-headings or bulleted lists, transforming the raw text dump into a structured, navigable document.","The user has just copied the full, unstructured reviews into a Google Doc. Her immediate next step will be to manually read, parse, and structure this text; this tool automates that tedious and error-prone organizational process directly within her chosen environment.",3
31,Rebuttal Point Tagger,"A Google Docs Add-on that provides a sidebar for structured metadata tagging. The user can highlight any part of the review text (e.g., a sentence or paragraph) and apply predefined or custom tags like '[Major Concern]', '[Minor Suggestion]', '[Misunderstanding]', '[Question]'. The sidebar then provides a filterable dashboard view of all tagged points, allowing the user to instantly see all 'Major Concerns' grouped together, regardless of which reviewer they came from.","After organizing the reviews, the user will need to categorize and prioritize the points to address. This tool replaces manual highlighting or note-taking with a structured system that enables strategic sorting and filtering of reviewer feedback directly within the GDoc.",3
32,Actionable Promise Tracker,"A Google Docs Add-on that scans the user's drafted rebuttal text for sentences that imply future work (e.g., 'We will add...', 'We plan to revise...', 'This will be included in the final version.'). It allows the user to confirm these promises with a single click, which adds them to a persistent 'Camera-Ready Task List' in the Add-on sidebar. Each task in the list links back to the exact sentence and reviewer comment that prompted it.","As Dora writes her responses, she will make commitments for the final paper. This tool automates the creation of a to-do list from these promises as they are written, preventing them from being forgotten and ensuring a clear action plan for the next stage.",3
33,Semantic Paper Linker,"A Google Docs Add-on where the user first provides a link to their submitted PDF. Afterwards, she can highlight any reviewer comment in the Google Doc, and the tool will perform a semantic search on her PDF to find the most relevant section, paragraph, or figure. It then allows her to insert a smart chip or comment that, when hovered over, displays a preview of that specific part of her paper, eliminating the need to constantly switch windows to find context.","To understand and respond to reviews, Dora will need to constantly refer back to her original paper. This tool embeds that context directly into her rebuttal workspace, streamlining the process of connecting a reviewer's critique to the specific part of the work being critiqued.",3
34,Live Character Budgeting,"A Google Docs Add-on that provides a persistent sidebar for managing character limits. The user can define logical sections in her document (e.g., 'Intro', 'Response to R1', 'Response to R2'). The add-on displays a real-time character count for each section and for the total document. The user can set a 'budget' for each section, and a progress bar will visually indicate usage, turning red when a budget is exceeded, providing instant feedback during the writing process.","The user noted the rebuttal has length constraints. This tool integrates character count management directly into the writing environment, allowing for real-time adjustments and strategic allocation of space for each response, which is more efficient than writing and checking the count afterwards.",3
35,Interactive Theme Synthesizer,"A Google Docs Add-on that facilitates cross-reviewer synthesis. The user can highlight a key concept in one review (e.g., 'concerns about the novelty'). The tool then scans the entire document and highlights all other sentences and phrases from all reviewers that are semantically related to that concept. It then offers an option to 'Consolidate Theme', which creates a new heading in the document and copies all the highlighted quotes under it.","The user will need to identify and group similar points from different reviewers, a core part of rebuttal strategy. This tool assists this cognitive task by allowing the user to initiate a search for a theme and then automates the consolidation of related points, giving her control over the synthesis process.",3
36,Structured Comment Threads,"A Google Docs Add-on that enhances the default commenting system for collaborative rebuttals. When adding a comment to a review point, co-authors can categorize it as a '[Strategic Suggestion]', '[Wording Tweak]', or '[Question]'. The primary author can then filter comments by type and use special actions like 'Accept Tweak', which automatically applies the suggested text change to the document and resolves the comment, creating a more organized discussion.","Dora will likely collaborate with co-authors, and GDoc comments can become chaotic. This tool imposes a structure on the collaboration, separating strategic discussions from minor edits and creating a clear workflow for incorporating feedback.",3
37,Rhetorical Response Composer,"A Google Docs Add-on that provides context-aware writing assistance. After a review point has been tagged (using the 'Rebuttal Point Tagger'), the user can place her cursor to write a response. The Add-on then suggests several context-appropriate opening sentences. For a '[Misunderstanding]' tag, it might offer 'We thank the reviewer for highlighting this, and we will clarify our presentation by...' to help set a professional and effective tone.","Staring at a blank page to respond to criticism is difficult. This tool kickstarts the drafting process by providing rhetorically-sound sentence starters tailored to the specific nature of the review point, helping Dora frame her arguments effectively from the beginning.",3
38,Rebuttal Heatmap,"A Google Docs Add-on that provides a live visual overview of the rebuttal's progress directly within the document text. Based on the status of each review point (e.g., untagged, tagged but no response drafted, response drafted), the tool applies a subtle background color to the text of the review point itself (e.g., red for unaddressed, yellow for in-progress, green for complete). This creates a 'heatmap' of the document, showing at a glance which areas need the most attention.","As the rebuttal document grows, it can be hard to track progress. This tool provides an ambient, at-a-glance visualization of the rebuttal's status, helping Dora and her collaborators quickly identify what's done and what remains to be tackled.",3
39,Example-Driven Scaffolder,"A Google Docs Add-on that works in a split-pane view. On the right, it displays the 'Memes CSCW review synthesis' example document. When Dora highlights a review point in her own document on the left, the tool uses semantic analysis to find and display the most relevant section from the example document (e.g., how the example authors responded to a similar type of methodological critique). This provides targeted inspiration based on the specific problem she is tackling.","The user has already identified a key example to learn from. This tool makes the example an active part of her writing process, moving beyond simple viewing to providing contextually relevant excerpts that can guide her own argumentation and structure.",3
40,Thematic Quote Aggregator,"A Google Docs Add-on that reads the theme headings Dora has created (e.g., 'Novelty Concerns'). It then scans the 'Full Reviews' tab, identifies all sentences and paragraphs semantically related to that theme from all reviewers, and automatically copies them as a bulleted list under the corresponding heading in her 'Review Synthesis' tab. Each copied quote is linked back to its exact location in the raw review.","This tool automates Dora's immediate next action, which is to manually find and group specific reviewer comments under the themes she is creating. It saves significant time and reduces the risk of missing a relevant point.",4
41,Synthesis Heatmap Generator,"A Google Docs Add-on that analyzes the synthesized points grouped under each of Dora's themes. For each theme, it calculates a 'criticality score' based on the number of unique reviewers who mention it, the severity of the language used (e.g., 'fatal flaw' vs. 'minor suggestion'), and the associated reviewer scores. It then applies a subtle background color to Dora's theme headings (e.g., red for high-crit, yellow for medium), providing a visual guide to which issues are most important to address.","As Dora synthesizes reviews, she will need to prioritize which themes are most important. This tool provides data-driven visual cues directly in her document to help her focus on the most impactful issues first.",4
42,Intra-Theme Contradiction Flag,"After Dora has grouped points under a theme using the 'Thematic Quote Aggregator', this tool analyzes the sentiment and content of the quotes within that single theme. If it detects directly contradictory advice (e.g., Reviewer A: 'The user study is convincing', Reviewer B: 'A user study is needed'), it highlights both quotes and adds a suggested comment flagging the contradiction for the authors to address.","Dora will inevitably encounter conflicting advice. This tool helps her quickly spot these contradictions within her own thematic groupings, which is a critical step for forming a rebuttal strategy.",4
43,Response Strategy Scaffolder,"A Google Docs Add-on where Dora can tag a synthesized theme with a response category (e.g., 'Misunderstanding', 'Agree & Fix', 'Disagree'). The tool then inserts a pre-formatted, collapsible response block with structured prompts, such as '[Acknowledge Point] > [State Clarification] > [Point to Paper Evidence] > [Propose Change in Paper]'. This provides a best-practice template for structuring the argument for each response.","This tool helps Dora transition from synthesizing points to strategically planning her response. It provides a structured framework for each point, ensuring she formulates a complete and persuasive argument for different types of critiques.",4
44,Reviewer Context Hover,"A Google Docs Add-on that first parses the 'Full Reviews' tab to create a summary profile for each reviewer (e.g., 'Reviewer B, Score: 2, Main Concern: Evaluation'). Later, in the 'Review Synthesis' tab, when Dora hovers her mouse over any quote, a small pop-up appears displaying the profile of the reviewer who wrote it. This provides instant context without leaving the synthesis view.","While synthesizing, it's easy to lose track of which reviewer made a specific point and their overall stance. This tool eliminates the need for Dora to constantly switch tabs to regain context, streamlining her analysis workflow.",4
45,Review Coverage Highlighter,"A tool that links Dora's 'Full Reviews' and 'Review Synthesis' tabs. As quotes are added to the synthesis tab, the tool finds the corresponding original text in the 'Full Reviews' tab and applies a semi-transparent highlight. This allows Dora to see at a glance which parts of the original reviews have not yet been addressed in her synthesis, preventing key points from being accidentally overlooked.",This tool provides crucial quality assurance during the synthesis process. It gives Dora confidence that her synthesis is comprehensive by visually tracking coverage of the source material.,4
46,Workload Forecaster,"A Google Docs Add-on that activates when Dora writes a phrase implying future work (e.g., 'we will run another study'). It pops up a small widget allowing her to categorize the task's effort (Low, Med, High) and add an optional time estimate. A sidebar panel keeps a running tally of the total estimated workload for the camera-ready version based on all proposed changes, providing a real-time reality check on the promises being made.","As Dora strategizes responses, she will be implicitly committing to future work. This tool makes that cost explicit during the planning phase, helping the team make informed decisions about what is feasible to promise.",4
47,Collaborative Claim & Assign,"A Google Docs Add-on that enhances collaboration within the synthesis document. Co-authors can highlight a synthesized point and click a 'Claim' button in the sidebar, which adds their user icon next to the point. As the lead, Dora can 'Assign' a point to a co-author, which adds their name and sends them a notification, creating a clear and simple task-distribution system directly on the relevant text.","Once the synthesis is complete, the next step is often dividing the writing work. This tool formalizes that process within the document, providing a clearer and more organized alternative to messy comment threads.",4
48,Bi-Directional Syncing Anchor,"This Google Docs Add-on allows Dora to create a persistent, two-way link between a quote in the 'Full Reviews' tab and its summarized version in the 'Review Synthesis' tab. Clicking the anchor icon next to the text in either tab instantly jumps the view to its counterpart in the other tab. This is more robust than a standard hyperlink, as the anchors remain attached even if surrounding text is edited.","Dora is working across two related but separate views of the same information. This tool maintains the crucial link between the raw data and her summary, making navigation and verification much faster and more reliable.",4
49,Rebuttal Narrative Planner,"A tool that displays Dora's theme headings from her GDoc as movable cards in a sidebar. It allows her to drag and drop these themes into a logical sequence to plan the overall flow of her rebuttal. It also suggests common narrative structures (e.g., 'Address major flaws first', 'Group by reviewer'). Once she finalizes the order, the tool can automatically re-sequence the sections in her Google Doc to match her plan.","A good rebuttal has a persuasive narrative structure. This tool elevates Dora's thinking from individual points to the overall story, helping her structure her argument for maximum impact before she starts writing prose.",4
50,Quote Basket,"A Google Docs Add-on that provides a persistent sidebar acting as a temporary holding area or 'basket'. While reading the 'Full Reviews' tab, Dora can highlight any text and click a button to add the quote (along with its source reviewer ID) to the basket. In her 'Review Synthesis' tab, she can place her cursor under a theme and click another button to paste the entire contents of the basket, then clear it for the next theme. This streamlines the process of collecting quotes for a specific theme without constant tab switching.","This tool directly addresses Dora's current manual action of populating themes with quotes. It reduces the friction of switching between tabs and manually copying/pasting, speeding up the synthesis process while keeping her in full control of which quotes are selected.",5
51,Theme Distiller,"After Dora has grouped multiple quotes under a theme heading, she can select the entire block of quotes. This tool uses summarization AI to generate a single, concise sentence that captures the core criticism or question common to all the selected quotes. For example, it might turn three paragraphs about study participants into: 'Reviewers question the generalizability of our findings due to the limited and homogenous participant pool.'","Once quotes are grouped, the next step is to understand and articulate the central issue. This tool helps Dora move from a collection of quotes to a single, actionable problem statement, which is essential for framing a focused response.",5
52,Rebuttal Response Recipe,"An AI-powered GDoc Add-on that analyzes the specific quotes grouped under a theme to suggest a multi-step argumentative structure or 'recipe' for the response. For a theme with a misunderstanding and a valid critique, it might suggest a recipe like: '1. Acknowledge and Validate [Reviewer A's critique]. 2. Gently Correct [Reviewer B's misunderstanding] by referencing Figure 3. 3. Propose a specific, low-effort revision to address both points.' It would also provide sentence starters for each step.","Moving from synthesized points to a persuasive argument is a major challenge. This tool scaffolds the writing process by providing a logical, rhetorical structure tailored to the specific combination of feedback within each theme, helping to build a more coherent and effective argument.",5
53,Evidence Drawer,"A GDoc Add-on with a sidebar that connects to Dora's submitted PDF. It automatically extracts all figures, tables, and section headings into a browsable, filterable list with thumbnails. When drafting a response, she can click an item in the list to instantly copy a formatted reference (e.g., 'as shown in Figure 4') or drag-and-drop it into the document to embed a link that shows a preview of the evidence on hover.","Rebuttals heavily rely on pointing to evidence in the original paper. This tool predicts Dora's need to constantly reference her submission by making figures, tables, and sections instantly accessible, saving her the effort of hunting through the PDF and ensuring accurate referencing.",5
54,Intra-Theme Voice Analyzer,"After quotes are grouped under a theme, this tool analyzes the language of the quotes within that single group. It highlights the 'voices' present, such as one reviewer being positive ('the evaluation was solid') while another is negative ('the evaluation lacks rigor') on the same topic. It presents a summary like: 'Theme: Evaluation - Conflicting feedback. R1 is positive, R3 is critical. Strategy should address R3's critique without invalidating R1's praise.'","Dora is currently grouping quotes, but the next step is to strategize a response. This tool helps her immediately see the nuances and contradictions *within* a single theme, which is critical for crafting a response that skillfully navigates conflicting feedback.",5
55,Argument Dependency Mapper,"A visual GDoc sidebar tool that allows Dora to map logical dependencies between her planned responses. As she outlines her answers to each theme, she can draw a directed arrow from one theme to another, signifying that the argument in the second theme relies on a point made in the first. The tool would flag any circular dependencies (e.g., A depends on B, and B depends on A).","A rebuttal is a single, cohesive document, not a list of independent answers. This tool helps Dora plan the overall narrative structure and logical flow of her arguments, ensuring that her points build on each other effectively and do not create internal contradictions.",5
56,Personal Rebuttal Snippet Library,"A Google Docs Add-on that allows Dora to save her own best writing. When she crafts a particularly effective response to a theme (e.g., a very polite way to disagree with a major point), she can select the text and save it to a personal, searchable library with tags like '#disagreement' or '#methodology'. In future rebuttals, she can quickly search her own library for her battle-tested phrases and structures.","Writing rebuttals is a recurring task for academics. This tool helps Dora build institutional knowledge for herself, allowing her to codify and reuse her most successful rhetorical strategies, making future rebuttals faster and more effective.",5
57,Live Co-Author Cursors & Zones,"An enhancement for Google Docs collaboration. When a co-author is assigned a theme, their cursor in the document gets a persistent colored flag. Furthermore, Dora can designate a theme's section as a 'writing zone' for a specific co-author, which sends them a notification and visually delineates their area of responsibility directly in the document, reducing confusion over who is tackling which point.","As Dora moves from synthesis to writing, she will likely involve co-authors. This tool predicts this collaborative need by improving on GDoc's defaults, creating a clearer system for delegating work and tracking contributions on a per-theme basis.",5
58,Formatted Text Processor,"A Google Docs Add-on that scans the document for text matching a user-defined format (e.g., 'bolded purple font'). It then allows the user to perform actions on all matching text. Actions include: 1) Consolidate: Copy all matching text into a new document or a new section. 2) Categorize: If the text contains keywords like 'Dora:' or 'TODO:', it automatically sorts them into 'Author Notes' and 'Action Items' lists. 3) Hide/Reveal: Temporarily hide all the formatted text to create a clean view of just the reviewer quotes, and reveal it again to see the annotations.",This tool directly leverages Dora's current action of using a specific font style for her thoughts and TODOs. It helps her next action of consolidating these scattered notes into a coherent strategy document and a manageable task list without manual copying and pasting.,6
59,Tri-Pane Rebuttal Workbench,"A Google Docs Add-on that provides a three-pane view for drafting responses. When Dora clicks on a theme heading, Pane 1 (left) displays the aggregated reviewer quotes for that theme. Pane 2 (middle) displays her corresponding 'Dora: XYZ' notes that have been automatically extracted. Pane 3 (right) is a rich text editor where she can draft the formal response, using the other two panes for context. The panes are vertically scroll-locked to the selected theme.","After synthesizing quotes and jotting down notes (current action), Dora's next step is to draft the actual rebuttal. This tool prevents constant scrolling and context-switching by presenting the source quotes, her private thoughts, and the writing space together in one unified, focused interface.",6
60,Dynamic Promise Manager,"A Google Docs Add-on that specifically parses the document for text matching the 'TODO: XYZ' format. It automatically converts each found item into an interactive task in a sidebar checklist. Each task can be assigned to a co-author, given a priority level (High/Medium/Low), and marked with a status (To Do, In Progress, Done). The checklist item is bi-directionally linked to the original 'TODO' text in the document.","Dora is currently creating an informal, static list of promises ('TODO: XYZ'). Her next action will be to manage and eventually execute these tasks. This tool transforms her raw notes into a structured, collaborative, and trackable project plan directly within her working document.",6
61,Argument Refiner,"An AI-powered tool that takes Dora's informal 'Dora: XYZ' notes as input. For each note, it generates three alternative phrasings for the formal rebuttal: one that is more 'Diplomatic & Appreciative', one that is more 'Direct & Technical', and one that is 'Concise & High-Level'. Dora can then choose the best starting point for her official response, helping to bridge the gap between raw thought and polished prose.","Dora is writing down her initial thoughts, which may be raw or unpolished. Her next step is to formulate these into persuasive arguments. This tool accelerates that process by providing rhetorically-aware options that help her set the right tone for each response.",6
62,Rebuttal Compiler,"A final-stage tool for Google Docs. Dora tags sections of her document as 'Final Response', 'Reviewer Quote', or 'Internal Note'. When run, the tool generates a new, clean Google Doc containing only the sections tagged as 'Final Response', arranged in the desired order. It also provides a total character count and flags any responses that exceed a user-defined budget, preparing the rebuttal for final submission.","Dora's current document is a working space mixing quotes, notes, and drafts. Her future action will be to create a clean document for submission. This tool automates the tedious and error-prone process of manually compiling the final text, ensuring no internal notes are accidentally included.",6
63,Structured Annotation Layer,"A Google Docs Add-on that allows Dora to highlight any text and add a structured, non-printing note instead of typing directly into the document. When she highlights a quote, a small pop-up appears with fields for '[My Thought]' and '[Action Item]'. These annotations are stored as metadata and can be viewed in a filterable sidebar or toggled on/off as an overlay, keeping the main document clean.","This tool improves upon Dora's current workflow of mixing notes into the document text. It anticipates her future need for a clean, shareable document by separating the source material (quotes) from her personal analysis from the very beginning, making collaboration and final compilation easier.",6
64,Rebuttal Workload Dashboard,"A sidebar Add-on that visualizes the effort required for the camera-ready version. It automatically parses all 'TODO:' items and allows Dora to assign an 'Effort' score (e.g., 1-5) to each. The dashboard then displays a summary graph showing the total workload, the distribution of effort (e.g., how many 'high effort' tasks exist), and which co-author is assigned the most work. This provides a real-time sanity check on the promises being made.","Dora is currently making promises ('TODO:') without a clear view of the cumulative effort. Before finalizing the rebuttal, she and her team will need to assess if the proposed changes are feasible. This tool provides an immediate, high-level overview of the workload, preventing over-commitment.",6
65,Response Zone Assigner,"A collaborative GDoc tool. Dora can select a whole theme block (heading, quotes, and her notes) and convert it into a 'Response Zone'. She can then assign this zone to a co-author. For the assigned co-author, the zone becomes editable, while for others it is locked. The zone also contains a private sub-thread for discussion between Dora and the assignee, keeping strategic conversations tied to their context.","After initial synthesis, Dora's next step will likely involve delegating responses to co-authors. This tool formalizes the hand-off process, preventing confusion about who is responsible for which point and containing all relevant materials (quotes, notes, discussion) in one self-contained unit.",6
66,Collaborative Strategy Poll,"A Google Docs commenting feature. When Dora is unsure how to respond to a point, she can initiate a 'Strategy Poll' in a comment. She can propose 2-3 short response strategies (e.g., 'A: Clarify misunderstanding', 'B: Agree and promise to fix'). Co-authors receive a notification and can vote on the options within the comment thread. The results are displayed visually, helping the team quickly reach a consensus.","Dora is currently writing her own thoughts, but rebuttal writing is a team effort. This tool facilitates the future action of deciding on a final strategy for contentious points by providing a fast, structured way to gather co-author feedback, rather than relying on long, unstructured comment chains.",6
67,Dual-Mode Editor,"A Google Docs Add-on that provides a toggle between two viewing modes. 'Workbench Mode' shows all document content, including reviewer quotes, personal annotations (like 'Dora: XYZ'), and action items ('TODO: XYZ'). 'Submission Preview Mode' instantly hides all annotations and quotes, displaying only the formal response text, concatenated and cleanly formatted. Edits can be made in either mode and are synchronized, allowing for live preview of the final submission document while writing.","After organizing her points (Action 8), Dora's next step is to draft the formal rebuttal. This tool addresses the need to write and edit within a messy working document while constantly needing to check what the clean, submittable version will look like and how it flows.",7
68,Camera-Ready Commitment Ledger,"This tool parses all 'TODO: XYZ' items from the Google Doc into a dashboard. For each item, Dora can assign a co-author, estimate the workload (in hours or days), and set a priority. The tool then visualizes these commitments on a timeline leading up to the camera-ready deadline, highlighting potential over-commitments or scheduling conflicts. It can also sync these tasks to an external project manager like Trello or Asana.","Dora is currently creating 'TODO' items as she synthesizes reviews (Action 7). This tool helps her manage the downstream consequences of these promises by turning them into a concrete, actionable project plan for the next version of the paper.",7
69,Internal Consistency Sentinel,"An AI-powered background tool that analyzes the text of the drafted rebuttal in real-time. It identifies and flags potential self-contradictions in the arguments being made. For example, if a response to Reviewer 1 promises a new experiment, while a response to Reviewer 2 argues the current evaluation is sufficient, the tool will highlight both statements and ask the user to resolve the inconsistency.","As Dora drafts responses to different points, she may inadvertently introduce conflicting arguments. This tool prevents such errors by providing automated proofreading for logical consistency across the entire document, which is a critical step after initial drafting.",7
70,Elastic Budget Manager,"A visual character count manager. Dora sets a single, total character limit for the entire rebuttal. The tool displays a persistent bar graph where each section (e.g., 'Response to Theme 1') has a bar representing its character usage. As she types more in one section, its bar grows while the potential space for all other sections visually shrinks, creating a dynamic, zero-sum visualization of the space trade-offs she is making in real-time.","Dora has prioritized her sections (Action 8) and will next need to draft responses within a strict character limit. This tool elevates simple character counting by forcing a conscious, visual decision about how to allocate a finite resource across her prioritized points.",7
71,Peer Review Overlay,"A collaborative mode for Google Docs. When a co-author activates this mode, their edits do not change the document directly. Instead, their proposed additions, deletions, and comments appear as a non-destructive, color-coded overlay. Dora, as the lead, can then review these suggestions and click to 'accept' or 'reject' each one individually, which then applies the change to the main document.","The next logical step after Dora's solo drafting is sharing the work with co-authors. This tool provides a structured review process similar to a GitHub pull request, preventing chaotic direct edits and giving Dora clear control over the final text.",7
72,Core Critique Responder,"An interactive tool that scaffolds the writing process for a single theme. After Dora groups reviewer quotes, she selects the group. The tool first generates a one-sentence summary of the core critique. It then presents a structured form with fields for 'Acknowledge', 'Counter-Argument', 'Evidence from Paper', and 'Promised Action'. After filling the fields, the tool assembles the inputs into a well-structured paragraph draft.","This tool directly supports the transition from synthesizing quotes (Action 6) to drafting a response. It structures the cognitive task of forming an argument, ensuring all key rhetorical components are included for a robust and persuasive response.",7
73,Response Flow Assistant,"This tool leverages the user's manual ordering of rebuttal sections. As Dora finishes writing the response for one section, the tool suggests context-aware transition phrases for the beginning of the next section. For example, it might suggest, 'While the concern about novelty is our primary focus, we now turn to the related point about our experimental setup,' creating a cohesive narrative flow through the document.","Dora has just reordered her sections by priority (Action 8). This tool uses that deliberate structure to help her craft a document that reads as a single, flowing argument rather than a disjointed list of answers, improving the rebuttal's overall quality.",7
74,Contribution Fingerprinter,"This tool integrates with the version history of the paper's original source (e.g., Overleaf or Google Docs). It analyzes the source to determine which co-author wrote or significantly edited which sections of the submitted paper. When a reviewer's comment is linked to a specific part of the paper, the tool automatically suggests assigning the rebuttal response to the co-author with the corresponding 'fingerprint', ensuring the person with the most context handles it.","To effectively draft responses, Dora will need to collaborate. This tool automates the process of assigning tasks by using the paper's history to identify the most qualified co-author for each point, making collaboration more efficient.",7
75,Persuasion Strategy Auditor,"A final-stage analysis tool. It scans the complete draft rebuttal and classifies each response based on its underlying rhetorical strategy (e.g., 'Correcting Misunderstanding', 'Agree & Promise Fix', 'Politely Disagree'). It then presents a dashboard summarizing the strategies used, such as 'You have 4 'Promises' and 2 'Disagreements'. Both disagreements are with Reviewer 2.' This provides a high-level strategic overview of the rebuttal's persuasive stance.","Before submission, Dora will need to perform a final review for tone and strategy. This tool automates that review, helping her see the overall shape of her argument and identify potential issues, like appearing overly defensive to a specific reviewer.",7
76,Rebuttal Argument Composer,"An AI tool that synthesizes Dora's informal notes into a formal draft. For a given theme, it ingests the aggregated reviewer quotes, Dora's 'Dora: XYZ' notes, and her 'TODO: XYZ' items. It then generates a structured paragraph that professionally acknowledges the reviewer's point, incorporates the core of Dora's planned argument, and seamlessly integrates the promised 'TODO' as a future commitment.","Dora has populated her synthesis with informal notes and action items (Action 7). This tool directly facilitates the next step of drafting by acting as an intelligent assistant that translates these raw, disconnected thoughts into a cohesive, formal paragraph, significantly accelerating the writing process.",7
77,Unified Feedback Inbox,"A sidebar in Google Docs that connects to Dora's Slack. It automatically pulls in all replies from the specific Slack thread where she shared the document link, along with all new Google Doc comments. Each piece of feedback is presented as an actionable item in a unified list, which can be sorted, filtered by author, and marked as 'resolved' or 'needs discussion'.","Dora just initiated a feedback process on Slack for her Google Doc, creating two separate streams of input. This tool will centralize all collaborator feedback into one manageable interface directly within her primary workspace, preventing comments from being missed and streamlining the review of her team's suggestions.",8
78,Feedback-to-Task Converter,"A Google Docs Add-on that allows Dora to act on collaborator feedback with a single click. When hovering over a GDoc comment or an imported Slack message from the 'Unified Feedback Inbox', an 'Assign Task' button appears. Clicking it converts the comment's text into a task in a shared checklist and assigns it to the commenter (or someone else), directly turning suggestions into accountable action items.","The next step after discussion is execution. This tool directly connects the feedback Dora is about to receive with the actions that need to be taken, bridging the gap between her synthesis document and the actual work of drafting the rebuttal or planning paper revisions.",8
79,Collaborative AI Draft Partner,"An AI-powered assistant within the Google Docs comment section. After the team agrees on a strategy for a point, Dora can invoke the AI, which reads the reviewer's quote, her notes, and the strategy discussion to generate a first draft of the rebuttal response. Collaborators can then leave feedback on the AI's draft, and the AI will iteratively refine the text based on their suggestions.","Translating the synthesized points and informal notes into polished rebuttal prose is a key next step. This tool automates the initial drafting, using the rich context of the team's discussion to produce a strong starting point, and facilitates a collaborative refinement process.",8
80,Camera-Ready Promise Planner,"A tool that automatically parses the document for all text formatted as 'TODO: XYZ'. It extracts these into a dedicated 'Camera-Ready Plan' tab within the GDoc. For each extracted promise, it uses semantic analysis to find the most relevant figure, table, or section in the original submitted PDF and suggests a smart link, connecting the promise directly to the part of the paper that needs revision.","Dora is already creating a list of promises ('TODOs') for the final paper. This tool formalizes that list, making it an actionable plan and, crucially, links each task to its specific context within the paper itself, which will be vital for the post-rebuttal revision phase.",8
81,Discussion Hotspot Visualizer,"A GDoc Add-on that provides a 'heat map' overlay on the synthesis document. It analyzes the comment threads and applies a color gradient to the text—from cool blue (few or resolved comments) to warm red (many unresolved comments, high back-and-forth replies). This gives Dora an instant visual summary of which points are most contentious or require the most urgent attention from the team.","As Dora's collaborators begin providing feedback, the document will become filled with discussions. This tool will help her immediately identify the most critical and debated points, allowing her to prioritize where she focuses the team's energy to achieve consensus.",8
82,Asynchronous Rebuttal Huddle,"For a particularly complex reviewer point, Dora can initiate a 'Huddle'. This creates a temporary, structured forum in the GDoc sidebar focused on that single point. It presents the evidence (reviewer quotes, Dora's notes) and prompts collaborators to answer specific questions (e.g., 'What is our core counter-argument?', 'What evidence from the paper supports this?') within a set time frame (e.g., 24 hours). Afterwards, it generates a summary of the inputs.","Coordinating a real-time meeting with her advisors and co-authors will be difficult. This tool facilitates focused, deep discussion on the hardest problems asynchronously, ensuring that complex decisions can be made efficiently without needing to align schedules.",8
83,Strategy Lock-In Tool,"For each of Dora's synthesized themes, this tool adds a 'Strategy' dropdown menu with options like ['Acknowledge & Fix', 'Clarify Misunderstanding', 'Respectfully Disagree']. Once the team agrees and selects an option, the tool adds a formal tag to that section. It can then offer context-aware writing templates or flag draft text that seems to contradict the locked-in strategy.","After discussion, the team needs to commit to a specific argumentative approach for each point. This tool formalizes that commitment directly in the document, creating a clear, agreed-upon plan that guides the subsequent writing process and ensures consistency.",8
84,Slack Rebuttal Assistant,"A bot for the #dora-advising Slack channel that is linked to the synthesis Google Doc. Team members can issue commands like '/rebuttal status' to get a summary of progress, '/rebuttal get_point ""Novelty""' to pull the relevant quotes and notes into Slack, or '/rebuttal assign ""Evaluation concerns"" to @coauthor' to create tasks in the GDoc directly from chat.","Dora initiated the feedback loop in Slack, indicating it's a central communication hub for her team. This tool allows the team to query status and perform quick management actions from within Slack, reducing the need to constantly switch back to the GDoc and integrating the tool into their existing workflow.",8
85,Rebuttal Role Definer,"A GDoc sidebar where Dora can define roles for the rebuttal process (e.g., 'Lead Strategist', 'Primary Drafter for R1', 'Tone & Polish Editor'). She can assign these roles to collaborators. The tool then provides role-specific views or permissions; for instance, the 'Primary Drafter' for a section might have exclusive editing rights to the response box for a period, preventing conflicting edits.","To manage the collaborative effort efficiently, clear roles are needed. This tool moves beyond simple task assignment to define and enforce responsibilities for the rebuttal process itself, ensuring that everyone knows their specific contribution and preventing a 'too many cooks' problem during the drafting phase.",8
86,Rebuttal Response Composer,"A Google Docs Add-on with a dynamic, context-aware sidebar. When the user places their cursor under a heading in their 'Rebuttal' draft (e.g., 'Response to Novelty Concerns'), the sidebar automatically finds the corresponding theme in the 'Review Synthesis' tab and displays three things: 1) The aggregated reviewer quotes for that theme. 2) The user's informal notes and TODOs for that theme. 3) An AI-powered 'Refine Note' button that transforms the informal notes into a professionally worded paragraph suitable for the rebuttal, which can be inserted directly into the document.",This tool directly supports the user's next action of drafting the rebuttal by eliminating the need to switch between tabs or documents to see her synthesized points and raw notes. It streamlines the cognitive load of translating informal thoughts into a formal response by providing an AI-assisted starting point.,10
87,Rhetorical Style Importer,"A Google Docs Add-on that analyzes a provided example rebuttal (like the 'DeduceIt' one the user is viewing). It extracts the example's structural hierarchy (headings, subheadings) and allows the user to apply it as a template to their own rebuttal draft with one click. It also extracts common phrases, categorizes them by rhetorical intent (e.g., 'Acknowledging a flaw', 'Politely disagreeing'), and makes them available in a searchable sidebar to help the user adopt a successful writing style.","The user is currently studying an example rebuttal to guide her writing. This tool automates the process of learning from that example, helping her structure her document and choose effective language without manually deconstructing the example document herself.",10
88,Rebuttal Command Center,A persistent sidebar in Google Docs that provides a live dashboard for managing the rebuttal. It features three integrated modules: 1) A 'Character Budget' module that tracks the total character count against the conference limit. 2) A 'Coverage Tracker' that displays a checklist of all themes from the 'Review Synthesis' tab and automatically marks them as complete as the user writes the corresponding sections in the draft. 3) A 'Promise Ledger' that automatically extracts all 'TODO:' items to create a list of commitments for the camera-ready version.,"As the user drafts her rebuttal, she will need to manage length, ensure all points are addressed, and keep track of promises made. This tool consolidates these critical monitoring tasks into a single, live view, preventing her from having to stop writing to manually check these details.",10
89,Diplomatic Reframing Tool,"An AI-powered tool accessible via the right-click menu in Google Docs. The user can highlight her own informal, blunt note (e.g., 'R1 is wrong, they missed Sec 4.2') and select 'Reframe Diplomatically'. The tool generates several alternative phrasings that acknowledge the reviewer's point before gently correcting the misunderstanding, using professional and non-confrontational language.","Writing a rebuttal requires a specific, diplomatic tone, especially when disagreeing with a reviewer. This tool directly aids in crafting these sensitive responses, helping the user convert her direct internal thoughts into persuasive prose that is less likely to alienate the reviewers.",10
90,In-Line Evidence Linker,"A Google Docs Add-on that connects to the user's submitted PDF. As the user writes references in her rebuttal draft (e.g., '...as shown in Figure 3' or '...detailed in Section 4.2'), the tool automatically creates a smart chip. Hovering over the chip shows a thumbnail preview of the corresponding figure or section from the PDF. If a reference is invalid (e.g., 'Figure 10' doesn't exist), the chip turns red as a visual warning.","The user will need to frequently reference her original paper to support her claims. This tool makes the process of verifying these references seamless and error-proof, embedding the evidence directly into the writing context and preventing embarrassing errors in the final submission.",10
91,Institutional Knowledge Base,"A shared snippet library integrated into Google Docs for the user's research group. When a lab member (including the user) writes a particularly effective rebuttal response, they can select it and save it to the shared library with tags (e.g., '#disagreement', '#UIST', '#methodology'). When writing a new rebuttal, the user can search this library to find and reuse battle-tested, successful phrasing from her and her colleagues' past work.","The user is currently referencing past work from her lab. This tool formalizes and enhances that process, creating a living, searchable repository of best practices that allows the entire lab to benefit from each individual's experience, improving the quality and efficiency of future rebuttals.",10
92,Narrative Consistency Analyzer,"An AI tool that performs a holistic analysis of the entire rebuttal draft. It reads all the individual responses and generates a report that: 1) Summarizes the main argument for each section. 2) Flags potential internal contradictions (e.g., claiming a limitation in response to R1 but a strength in response to R2). 3) Identifies 'dropped threads' where an issue mentioned in the introduction is not fully addressed in the body.","When writing a response piece by piece, it's easy to lose sight of the overall narrative or introduce subtle contradictions. This tool acts as an AI proofreader that checks for logical and narrative consistency across the entire document before the user shares it with co-authors.",10
93,Conciseness Coach,"An interactive Google Docs Add-on that helps the user meet strict character limits. When the user highlights a sentence or paragraph, the tool provides suggestions for making it more concise. It visually flags filler words, suggests replacing long phrases with shorter alternatives (e.g., 'in order to' -> 'to'), and provides a 'Conciseness Score' for the selected text, gamifying the editing process.","Conference rebuttals have notoriously tight length constraints, a problem the user will inevitably face while drafting. This tool provides interactive, real-time feedback to help her write concisely from the start, rather than having to painfully cut characters from a finished draft.",10
94,Persona-Based Sanity Check,"An AI tool that simulates how reviewers might perceive the draft. It first analyzes the original reviews to create a simple profile of each reviewer's priorities (e.g., R1 cares about novelty; R2 about evaluation). The user can then run the tool on her rebuttal draft, and it will provide targeted feedback, such as: 'Your response to R2 focuses on novelty but does not directly address their core concern about the evaluation's rigor.'","A successful rebuttal must speak directly to each reviewer's specific concerns. This tool helps the user ensure her arguments are well-aligned with the reviewer's original critique, acting as a 'fresh set of eyes' to check if the responses will actually be persuasive to their intended audience.",10
95,Submission Formatter,"A final-stage utility tool in Google Docs. The user designates the final rebuttal text and selects the target conference (e.g., 'UIST') from a preset list. The tool then strips all formatting, converts special characters, checks for any unsupported elements, performs a final character count according to the specific rules of that conference's submission system, and copies the clean, submission-ready plain text to the clipboard.","The final step of transferring a rebuttal from a rich text editor to a restrictive web form is tedious and error-prone. This tool automates this entire process, ensuring the final text adheres to all technical submission requirements and preventing last-minute formatting issues.",10
96,Rebuttal Evidence Scout,"A Google Docs Add-on with a sidebar. The user highlights a claim or sentence in their rebuttal draft. The tool analyzes this text and automatically generates targeted search queries for academic databases like Google Scholar and ACM DL. The search results are displayed directly in the sidebar, complete with abstracts and direct PDF links, allowing the user to find and assess supporting literature without leaving their document.","This tool directly addresses the user's current action of manually searching for literature. It streamlines the predicted next actions of refining search queries and assessing relevance by integrating the search and triage process into the writing environment, reducing context switching.",12
97,Citation Chain Explorer,"When the user finds a relevant paper, this browser extension or web tool allows them to input the paper's DOI or title. It then generates an interactive, visual graph of that paper's citation network. It highlights papers that cite the seed paper and papers cited by it, filtering them by venue (e.g., UIST, CHI), year, and author, allowing for rapid discovery of related work.","The user is currently using keyword searches, which can be limiting. This tool augments that capability by enabling discovery through citation chaining, a common but manual research task, helping her find clusters of relevant work she might otherwise miss.",12
98,Argumentative Phrase Generator,"An AI-powered Google Docs Add-on. After the user finds a supporting paper, they can link it to a claim in their rebuttal. The tool then reads the paper's abstract and suggests several professionally phrased sentences to integrate the evidence into the argument, such as 'Our findings are corroborated by Smith et al., who demonstrated...' or 'This builds on prior work by Jones et al. which established...'","The user's next step after finding evidence is to integrate it into her rebuttal. This tool automates the often tedious task of crafting sentences that correctly and persuasively connect her claims to the evidence she has found, saving time and improving the quality of her writing.",12
99,Semantic Query Expander,"A search tool where the user can input not just keywords, but an entire sentence or paragraph from a reviewer's comment. The tool uses natural language processing to identify the core concepts and searches academic databases for papers related to that semantic meaning, even if they use different terminology. The results are ranked by their conceptual similarity to the input text.","The user's current keyword search ('UIST + sociotechnical') is broad and may miss relevant work that uses different jargon. This tool helps overcome the limitations of keyword search, allowing her to find more relevant papers based on the actual concepts in the reviewers' critiques.",12
100,Adversarial Search Assistant,"A special search mode in an academic search engine. The user inputs a claim from their rebuttal, and the tool specifically searches for literature that contradicts, challenges, or presents limitations to that claim. It flags conflicting findings and alternative approaches presented in the literature.","A strong rebuttal anticipates counter-arguments. This tool helps the user proactively find potential weaknesses in her arguments by searching for disconfirming evidence, allowing her to strengthen her claims before the reviewers can poke holes in them.",12
101,Cross-Venue Relevance Analyzer,"A browser extension that enhances Google Scholar or ACM DL results. When the user performs a search, it analyzes each resulting paper and adds a 'Relevance to UIST' score. This score is calculated based on how frequently the paper, its authors, or its cited works appear in the proceedings of the target conference (UIST), providing a signal of community relevance beyond the publication venue itself.","The user is manually filtering by conference, but important related work can exist in adjacent fields. This tool automates and improves that filtering process by providing a more nuanced relevance signal, helping her identify influential papers from outside the immediate conference community.",12
102,Query-Focused Abstract Summarizer,"A feature within a search interface. When the user hovers over a search result, this tool provides a short, AI-generated summary of the abstract. The summary is specifically tailored to answer the question 'How does this paper relate to your search query?' instead of being a generic summary, allowing for much faster assessment of relevance.","The user's next action involves scrolling through papers and reading abstracts to assess relevance, which is time-consuming. This tool accelerates that triage process by providing instant, context-specific summaries, allowing her to evaluate more papers in less time.",12
103,Rebuttal Reference Manager,"A lightweight citation manager integrated into the Google Docs sidebar. The user can add papers they find to a project library. The tool allows for one-click insertion of formatted citations into the text and automatically generates a bibliography. Crucially, it tracks the character count of both the rebuttal text and the generated bibliography separately, helping the user budget space for references.","Managing citations and adhering to strict character limits is a key challenge in rebuttals. This tool addresses the specific pain point of budgeting space for references, which is a detail often overlooked by general-purpose character counters.",12
104,Paper Similarity Projector,"After finding an initial set of relevant papers, the user can upload them to this tool. The tool then analyzes these papers and performs a 'projection' search, looking for other papers in a vast database that are semantically similar in their methodology, problem space, or proposed solution. It presents new, undiscovered papers that are 'like' the ones she has already approved.","This tool provides a powerful new vector for discovery beyond keywords or direct citations. It helps automate the intuition of 'find me more papers like these,' which is a key part of the research process that the user is currently engaged in.",12
105,Overleaf Project Bridge,"A Google Docs Add-on that securely connects to the user's Overleaf project. It provides a sidebar to search the .tex source files directly from Google Docs. The user can find and insert verifiable, dynamic links to sections, figures, or tables (e.g., 'Section 3.1') into their rebuttal draft. Hovering over these links in the GDoc shows a preview snippet of the referenced content from the paper.","This directly addresses the inefficiency in the user's current action (13) of manually switching to Overleaf to find references in her own paper, streamlining the process of grounding rebuttal claims in the paper's content.",13
106,Promise Aggregator & Task Manager,"A tool that scans the entire Google Doc ('UIST Reviews - Knoll'). It extracts all text formatted as a 'TODO:' from the synthesis tab and all sentences implying future work (e.g., 'We will add...') from the final rebuttal draft. It then consolidates these into a single, de-duplicated checklist in a new tab, linking each task back to the original reviewer comment that prompted it.","The user is currently creating promises in two places (informal TODOs and formal rebuttal text). This tool automates the future, crucial task of consolidating these commitments into a single action plan for the camera-ready revision.",13
107,Argument Cross-Examiner,"An AI-powered tool that performs a holistic analysis of the complete rebuttal draft. It identifies and flags potential logical or strategic contradictions between different responses. For example, it would highlight if the response to R1 defends the study's scope as 'intentionally narrow' while the response to R3 promises to 'broaden the evaluation'.","As the user drafts responses to individual points (action 11), it's easy to lose track of the overall narrative. This tool helps with the future task of ensuring the final rebuttal is internally consistent and presents a coherent argument to the reviewers.",13
108,Camera-Ready Workload Forecaster,"An AI tool that reads the promises made in the rebuttal draft. It uses a model trained on academic publications to classify each promised task (e.g., 'rewrite introduction', 'add a new figure', 'run a follow-up study') by estimated effort (Low, Medium, High) and time. It then generates a dashboard visualizing the total workload commitment for the camera-ready version.","The user is actively making promises to revise the paper (actions 7, 11). This tool provides a real-time sanity check, helping her and her team understand the downstream consequences of their rebuttal strategy before committing to it.",13
109,Review Point Coverage Mapper,"A final-check tool within Google Docs. It displays all the synthesized review themes from the 'Review Synthesis' tab in a sidebar checklist. For each theme, the user must highlight the text in their final 'Rebuttal' draft that addresses it. The tool visually confirms the link and marks the item as 'Covered', flagging any review points that have not been addressed in the final draft.","The user has broken down reviews into themes (action 5) and is now drafting responses (action 11). This tool supports the critical future step of verifying that every single identified issue has been explicitly addressed in the rebuttal, preventing accidental omissions.",13
110,Camera-Ready Context Tagger,"An Overleaf plugin that allows the user to link text or code in her .tex file directly to a reviewer comment from her GDoc. When working on the camera-ready version weeks later, she can hover over the modified text in Overleaf to see a pop-up with the specific comment it addresses (e.g., 'This paragraph was added to clarify R2's question about novelty').","The user is currently looking up references in Overleaf (action 13). This tool closes the loop, ensuring that when she later revises the paper based on the rebuttal, the original context and motivation for each change are preserved directly within her writing environment.",13
111,Rebuttal-to-Paper Synchronized Viewer,"A web application that provides a split-screen view. The left pane loads the user's Google Doc rebuttal draft. The right pane loads the rendered PDF of their Overleaf paper. As the user clicks on different response sections in the Google Doc, the PDF view on the right automatically scrolls to the most relevant section or figure being discussed.","This tool radically improves the workflow shown in action 13. Instead of manually searching her paper, the user can maintain visual context between her argument and the evidence in her paper simultaneously, reducing context switching and improving accuracy.",13
112,Final Polish Review Mode,"A Google Docs mode designed for co-author review of the final draft. It locks the main text but allows collaborators to make 'Suggestions' which are categorized (e.g., Typo, Conciseness, Clarity). The tool shows the character count impact of each suggestion (e.g., '-15 chars') and allows the lead author to accept/reject them with a single click.","After drafting, the user will likely seek feedback from co-authors (similar to action 9). This tool structures that final, high-stakes feedback process, focusing it on polish and conciseness while maintaining control over the character-limited document.",13
113,Feedback Aggregator & Synthesizer,"A Google Docs Add-on that connects to a specified Slack channel. It scans the channel for messages that reference the Google Doc link. It then ingests those messages and any replies, converting them into structured comments within the Google Doc, attributed to the correct author and linked to the relevant Slack conversation. The tool can also be triggered to scan all existing comments in the document and generate a summary report of feedback themes, such as 'clarity concerns', 'requests for more detail', or 'wording suggestions'.","Dora's next action is to process feedback from her advising channel. This tool automates the inefficient and error-prone process of manually tracking feedback from both Slack and Google Doc comments, ensuring no suggestion is lost and providing a high-level summary of feedback to guide her revisions.",14
114,Suggestion Impact Analyzer,"An enhancement to Google Docs' 'Suggesting' mode. For every suggestion box containing an insertion or deletion, the tool displays a live character count delta (e.g., '+45 chars' or '-20 chars'). It also adds a 'What-If' panel to the sidebar, allowing Dora to select multiple pending suggestions and see the cumulative impact on the total character count before accepting any of them.","After receiving feedback, Dora will revise her draft. This tool directly addresses the critical challenge of incorporating edits while adhering to strict character limits, allowing her to make informed trade-offs between different suggestions without constant manual re-counting.",14
115,Conference Submission Simulator,"A Google Docs Add-on that provides a high-fidelity preview of the final submission. Dora selects the conference (e.g., UIST). The tool opens a sidebar that perfectly mimics the official submission system's text box, including its specific font, width, and character counting algorithm. It renders her final text, flags unsupported characters (like emojis or special symbols), and provides a 'Copy for Submission' button that places perfectly sanitized, validated plain text onto the clipboard.","Dora's final step will be submitting the rebuttal. This tool de-risks the painful and often frustrating process of transferring text from a rich editor to a restrictive web form, preventing formatting errors and last-minute character count surprises.",14
116,Overleaf Promise-Sync,"A Google Docs Add-on that securely connects to Dora's Overleaf project. The tool parses her entire rebuttal document for 'TODO:' items and phrases implying future work ('we will add...', 'we plan to revise...'). It then syncs these promises into a new `rebuttal_checklist.tex` file within the Overleaf project, formatted as a task list. Each item in the list is linked back to the GDoc comment that prompted it.","Dora has been meticulously creating 'TODO' items which represent promises for the final paper. This tool bridges the gap between the rebuttal (in GDocs) and the final revision (in Overleaf), creating a canonical, actionable checklist directly inside the environment where the work will be done, ensuring promises are not forgotten.",14
117,Feedback Conflict Resolution Panel,"A GDoc Add-on that scans all comments and suggestions on the draft. When it detects semantically opposing feedback on the same piece of text (e.g., one comment asks to 'expand' while another asks to 'shorten'), it flags the section. It then creates a special 'Resolution Thread' that pings the conflicting commenters, presents the two opposing suggestions side-by-side, and allows Dora to initiate a poll for other collaborators to vote on the best path forward.","When incorporating feedback from multiple advisors, Dora will likely encounter conflicting advice. This tool provides a structured workflow to identify, escalate, and resolve these conflicts efficiently, preventing stalemates and ensuring clear, team-aligned decisions.",14
118,Aural Sanity Checker,"A text-to-speech tool within Google Docs that reads the final rebuttal draft aloud. It offers different voice personas, such as 'Skeptical Reviewer' (a slightly critical, questioning tone), 'Supportive Advisor' (an encouraging tone), and 'Neutral Presenter' (a formal, conference-style tone). The user can control playback speed and listen section by section.","Before submission, Dora will perform a final review for tone and clarity. Hearing her own words read back in different simulated personas can reveal awkward phrasing, defensive language, or unclear arguments that are easily missed during silent reading, providing a powerful new modality for proofreading.",14
119,Rebuttal Snapshot Manager,"A Google Docs Add-on that provides granular, manual version control. At key moments (e.g., 'Pre-Feedback Draft', 'Post-Advisor-A-Edits'), Dora can click 'Create Snapshot' to save a named version of the document. The tool provides a visual timeline of these snapshots, showing the character count and a diff view between any two points, and allowing for easy restoration to a previous state.","As Dora revises the draft based on feedback, she may want to experiment with changes or backtrack. This tool offers more control than Google Docs' automatic version history, allowing her to create meaningful, labeled checkpoints of her work that are easy to compare and revert to.",14
120,One-Shot Citation Inserter,"A Google Docs sidebar where Dora can paste a paper's DOI or title. The tool instantly fetches the paper's data and presents: 1) A concise, AI-generated summary of the paper's main finding, optimized for low character count. 2) A pre-formatted citation. With one click, Dora can insert the summary into her rebuttal text and the full citation into a managed bibliography at the end, with live character count updates for both sections.","Feedback might require Dora to add new evidence, a process that is currently manual and time-consuming (steps 12 & 13). This tool dramatically accelerates the workflow of finding, summarizing, and inserting a new citation while managing the tight character budget of a rebuttal.",14
121,Pre-Submission Finalizer,"A GDoc sidebar providing a dynamic, context-aware checklist for final submission. The list is pre-populated with essential tasks (e.g., 'Run final spell check', 'Verify all themes from Synthesis tab are addressed'). It integrates with other tools by creating checklist items like 'Confirm character count in Submission Simulator'. The final 'Copy for Submission' button remains disabled until all critical tasks are checked off.","The final moments before submission are high-stress and prone to simple mistakes. This tool acts as a pilot's pre-flight checklist, formalizing the final review process and ensuring critical steps are not forgotten before Dora commits to submitting her finalized rebuttal.",14
122,Final Polish Assistant,"A Google Docs Add-on that performs a final automated proofreading pass on the rebuttal. It scans the document to: 1) Detect and list leftover annotations such as colored text, bracketed notes, or highlights. 2) Identify inconsistent terminology (e.g., using 'user study' in one section and 'experiment' in another) and suggest a standard term. 3) Provide a text-to-speech feature that reads the final text aloud to help catch awkward phrasing and improve flow.","After integrating feedback from multiple collaborators (action 15), Dora's next step is a final polish. This tool automates the tedious cleanup of formatting artifacts and inconsistencies, ensuring the document submitted is professional and clean.",15
123,Submission Character Calculator,"A Google Docs Add-on where Dora selects the target conference (e.g., UIST). The tool then loads the specific character-counting rules for that conference's submission system (e.g., how it handles spaces, line breaks, special characters) and provides a hyper-accurate live count. It also features a 'Trim Assist' mode that suggests verbose phrases or low-impact sentences that could be cut to meet the limit.","Dora will need to ensure her rebuttal meets a strict character limit. This tool provides an accurate count for the specific submission system, preventing last-minute surprises, and aids the difficult process of trimming text while preserving meaning.",15
124,Change Impact Dashboard,"A Google Docs sidebar that analyzes all pending 'Suggestions' from her collaborators. For each suggestion, it displays the character count delta (+/-). Dora can 'stage' multiple suggestions by checking boxes next to them, and the dashboard shows the cumulative character impact of all staged changes on her total count, allowing her to accept a batch of changes at once.","Dora is currently accepting suggestions (action 15) and must balance these edits with the character limit. This tool makes the trade-off explicit, allowing her to strategically decide which edits to accept based on their impact on the final length.",15
125,Argument Coherence Visualizer,"An AI tool that reads the entire final rebuttal draft. It generates a visual graph where each node is a major argument from her rebuttal. It automatically draws 'support' links between related arguments and, critically, 'contradiction' links (in red) if two arguments are logically inconsistent (e.g., arguing the system is simple for R1 but complex for R2), flagging areas that need reframing.","After integrating feedback from different people, the rebuttal's overall narrative can become fragmented. This tool provides a high-level, visual sanity check to ensure the final set of arguments is internally consistent before submission.",15
126,Color-Coded Change Finalizer,"A Google Docs Add-on that directly addresses her current workflow. It scans the document for all text formatted in her specific blue color. It then presents a list of these colored text snippets, allowing Dora to review them one-by-one and either 'Accept' (which removes the color, making it normal text) or 'Reject' (which deletes the text). An 'Accept All' button finalizes all changes at once.","Dora is currently using blue text to track significant changes (action 15) and will need to remove this formatting. This tool automates the process of reviewing and finalizing these specific, self-identified changes, preventing submission of a document with leftover annotations.",15
127,Camera-Ready Feasibility Score,"A tool that extracts all promises from the final rebuttal text (e.g., 'add new figure', 'run follow-up study'). It uses a model to estimate the effort/time for each task and asks Dora for her camera-ready deadline. It then generates a single 'Feasibility Score' (e.g., 95% - Realistic, 60% - Ambitious, 30% - At Risk) that quantifies whether the promised work is achievable in the available time.","Authors often over-promise in rebuttals. Before submitting, Dora needs to ensure her commitments are realistic. This tool provides a crucial, data-driven reality check on the workload she is signing up for, preventing future stress.",15
128,Plain Text Submission Converter,"A utility tool that prepares the rebuttal for submission. It reads the final text from the GDoc, identifies and converts special Unicode characters (e.g., smart quotes, em-dashes) into their plain ASCII equivalents, correctly handles citations based on user settings (e.g., strip or format as '[1]'), and removes all comments and color formatting. It produces perfectly clean plain text in a pop-up with a 'Copy to Clipboard' button.","Copying from Google Docs to a web form is a common failure point. This tool prevents submission errors by creating a clean, validated, plain-text version of the rebuttal that is guaranteed to paste correctly into any conference submission system.",15
129,Feedback Integration Verifier,"A tool that helps ensure all feedback is addressed. It lists all comments from Michael and Diyi in a sidebar. As Dora edits the document, the tool uses semantic similarity to suggest a link between a change and the comment it addresses. Before finishing, Dora can see a final checklist of all comments, with linked evidence of the change, and be alerted to any comments that have not yet been addressed.",Dora is integrating comments (action 15) and her next step is to be sure she didn't miss any. This tool provides a systematic way to verify that every piece of feedback has been considered and resolved in the final draft.,15
130,Final Read-Through Companion,"A Google Docs sidebar designed to structure the final proofread. It breaks the rebuttal down by section. As Dora reads a section, she clicks 'Mark as Read'. She can also 'Flag' a section that still feels weak or awkward. The sidebar shows a progress bar of her review and a list of flagged sections, allowing her to conduct a focused, final pass on only the problem areas.","The final read-through is a critical step requiring intense focus. This tool structures that process, ensuring every part is reviewed and creating a punch list of remaining issues for a final, targeted editing session before submission.",15
131,Annotation & Highlight Finalizer,"A pre-submission utility tool within Google Docs. It performs a final scan of the document specifically for leftover authoring artifacts. It generates a single, interactive report listing all instances of: 1) Colored text (like her blue tracking color). 2) Text with highlights. 3) Bracketed placeholder notes (e.g., '[TODO: check this]'). Dora can then click through the list to navigate to each artifact and choose to remove the formatting or delete the text, ensuring a clean final version.",Dora uses color-coding and other annotations to track changes and notes. A critical final step is to remove these internal markings. This tool automates the tedious and error-prone process of hunting for leftover annotations before submission.,16
132,Rhetorical Tone Map,"An AI tool that analyzes the final rebuttal draft and generates a visual 'tone map'. It color-codes each sentence or response based on its detected rhetorical strategy: green for 'Agree & Comply', blue for 'Clarify & Educate', yellow for 'Politely Disagree', and red for 'Defensive'. This provides a high-level, at-a-glance view of the rebuttal's overall tone and strategy, allowing Dora to quickly assess if it's too confrontational or too passive.","Dora is in the polishing stage, where tone is critical. This tool augments her own reading by providing an objective, visual summary of the rhetorical signals she is sending, helping her perform a final 'sanity check' to ensure the rebuttal is professional and persuasive.",16
133,Rebuttal Wargame Simulator,"An AI-powered tool that simulates the post-rebuttal discussion phase. The user uploads their final rebuttal and the original reviews. The tool then generates a likely conversation transcript between the reviewers (e.g., R1, R2, AC), showing how the rebuttal might influence their initial stances and lead to a final consensus. It models how a convinced reviewer might defend the paper against a skeptical one and predicts how scores might change during this discussion.","The user is currently simulating individual reviewer reactions with ChatGPT. This tool directly addresses that need by providing a more sophisticated, multi-agent simulation of the entire discussion phase, helping her anticipate the rebuttal's strategic impact before submission.",17
134,Persona-Driven Consistency Checker,"After the user has simulated personas for each reviewer (e.g., 'R1-focuses-on-novelty'), this tool ingests those personas. It then re-reads the entire rebuttal draft from the perspective of each persona, flagging specific sentences or arguments that are likely to be unpersuasive, contradictory, or irritating to that specific reviewer's known priorities and biases. It would highlight, for example, a technical argument aimed at R2 that might sound like hand-waving to R1.","This tool leverages the user's current action of simulating reviewer responses by turning those simulations into lenses for a final, targeted consistency check, ensuring the rebuttal is persuasive to each member of the audience.",17
135,Rebuttal Impact Report,"An AI tool that takes the original reviews and the final rebuttal as input to generate a high-level summary report. The report includes sections like 'Key Criticisms Addressed,' 'Potential Unaddressed Loopholes,' and 'Strength Reinforcement.' For each point, it quotes the relevant rebuttal text alongside the original review comment, creating a final 'sanity check' document for sharing with co-authors before submission.","As the user polishes the final rebuttal, she needs a way to step back and assess its overall strategic effectiveness. This tool automates the creation of a high-level summary, making it easier to spot gaps and verify that every major point has been effectively countered.",17
136,Final Submission Packet Compiler,"A one-click utility that automates the final packaging of all rebuttal-related materials. It creates a new folder in the user's Google Drive and populates it with: 1) A `rebuttal_final.txt` file, perfectly formatted as plain text according to the conference's specific character-counting rules. 2) A `camera_ready_plan.gdoc` that compiles all promises made in the rebuttal. 3) A `review_archive.pdf` that pairs each original review with its final response for easy reference.","The final step of submitting is tedious and error-prone. This tool automates the formatting and archival process, ensuring a correct submission and creating a well-organized record for future reference, addressing the user's immediate need to submit and her future need to recall the process.",17
137,Argument Volatility Indexer,"This AI tool analyzes each distinct argument or response within the rebuttal and assigns it a 'Volatility Score' from 0 (safe) to 10 (risky). A high score indicates a high-risk, high-reward gambit (e.g., strongly disagreeing with a reviewer), while a low score indicates a safe, agreeable response. It visualizes the scores across the document, allowing the user to assess the overall risk profile of their rebuttal strategy.","The user is simulating outcomes to gauge the risk of her arguments. This tool quantifies that risk, providing a novel metric to evaluate whether her rebuttal is strategically too aggressive or too passive before she commits to it.",17
138,Persuasion Strategy Audit,"An AI tool that analyzes the final rebuttal text and maps its content to known rhetorical and psychological persuasion techniques (e.g., ethos, pathos, logos; reciprocity, authority). It generates a report card, such as: 'Strong use of 'Authority' by citing key papers. Could improve 'Liking' by acknowledging reviewer effort more explicitly.' It provides suggestions for reframing sentences to be more persuasive.","The user is polishing her writing, and this tool offers a new lens for improvement beyond grammar and clarity. It focuses on the art of persuasion, helping her craft a rebuttal that is not just correct but also psychologically effective.",17
139,Camera-Ready Effort Calculator & Timeline,"This tool parses all promises from the final rebuttal. For each promise (e.g., 'run follow-up study'), it presents an interactive form asking for an estimated time in hours and dependencies (e.g., 'needs data from Michael'). It then automatically generates a visual GANTT chart or timeline of the required camera-ready work, flagging potential bottlenecks and calculating the total person-hours committed.","Making promises in a rebuttal is easy; fulfilling them is hard. This tool forces the user to translate her promises into a concrete project plan, providing a realistic forecast of the workload required if the paper is accepted.",17
140,Rebuttal Tone Harmonizer,"An AI tool that analyzes the linguistic tone of the user's rebuttal *relative to* the tone of the original reviews. It flags potential mismatches. For example, if a reviewer was very supportive but noted a minor point, and the rebuttal response is overly formal and defensive, it would suggest softening the language to be more collaborative. Conversely, if a reviewer was harsh, it would verify that the response remains professional and respectful.","The user is simulating reviewer personalities, indicating an awareness of the social dynamics at play. This tool helps her fine-tune the crucial but subtle aspect of tone, ensuring her rebuttal is strategically and emotionally appropriate for each specific reviewer.",17
141,Final-Checklist & Submission Lock,"A Google Docs sidebar that generates a pre-submission checklist tailored to a final rebuttal. The list includes items like 'Run spell check', 'Verify character count against limit', 'Confirm all themes from Synthesis are addressed', and 'Acknowledge all collaborator comments'. The tool integrates a 'Copy for Submission' button that remains disabled until all critical tasks on the checklist have been manually ticked off by the user.","In the final rush to submit, it's easy to forget a crucial step. This tool provides a structured, fail-safe process to ensure every final detail is checked, preventing common mistakes and giving the user confidence at the moment of submission.",17
142,Submission Portal Bridge,"A browser extension that securely connects to the user's Google Account. When the user navigates to a conference submission page, they can activate the extension, select the final rebuttal Google Doc, and the tool provides a button to 'Inject Rebuttal'. This action automatically pulls the sanitized plain text (using the logic from the 'Final Submission Sanitizer') and pastes it directly into the correct form field on the webpage, bypassing manual copy-and-paste.","The next step after finalizing the rebuttal is submission. This tool augments the user's browser to directly and safely connect her writing environment (Google Docs) with the submission environment (the conference website), eliminating potential copy-paste errors and reducing submission-day anxiety.",19
143,Rebuttal Archive & Debrief,"A tool that, after submission, generates a comprehensive debriefing report for the author and their team. It takes the original reviews and the final rebuttal as input and creates a structured document summarizing: 1) A side-by-side view of each key criticism and the final response. 2) A clean, consolidated list of all promises made for the camera-ready version. 3) An AI-generated summary of the overall rebuttal strategy.","The rebuttal process generates many artifacts (synthesis docs, drafts, comments). This tool helps Dora formalize the outcome by creating a single, clean document that serves as an archive for future reference and a debriefing summary for her collaborators, ensuring the knowledge is preserved.",19
144,Institutional Rebuttal Playbook,"A shared knowledge base for a research lab. After a rebuttal cycle is complete, the user can submit the (anonymized) review, their final response, and the outcome (accept/reject) to the playbook. The tool categorizes the review type (e.g., 'methodology flaw', 'novelty concern'). Lab members can later search this database for successful rebuttal strategies for specific types of critiques at specific conferences.","Dora's entire workflow is a valuable piece of institutional knowledge. This tool helps her and her lab build a long-term, private repository of successful rebuttal patterns, augmenting the 'Successful Rebuttal Library' (#10) with private, hyper-relevant, and outcome-aware data.",19
145,Final Tone & Confidence Analyzer,"An AI-powered text analysis tool that provides a final check on the rebuttal's tone. It reads the entire draft and provides a report with scores on two key axes: Professionalism (from 'Overly Apologetic' to 'Dismissive') and Confidence (from 'Hesitant' to 'Assertive'). It highlights specific sentences or phrases that are outliers and could be perceived negatively by reviewers, suggesting more neutral and confident alternatives.","Having iteratively refined the rebuttal with AI (Action 18) and collaborators (Action 15), a final check on the subtle but critical aspect of tone is necessary. This tool helps ensure the final text strikes the perfect balance of being respectful yet confident, which is crucial for persuasion.",19
146,Rebuttal Submission Verifier,"A browser extension that activates on the conference submission page. When text is pasted into the rebuttal textbox, it performs a real-time, three-way comparison between the source Google Doc, the text in the submission box, and the conference's formatting rules. It generates a 'diff' view highlighting any character changes, dropped formatting, or special character mangling. It also provides a final, hyper-accurate character count based on the submission system's specific algorithm, flagging if the text is over the limit.","Dora is at the final, high-stakes moment of pasting her rebuttal. This tool would alleviate the significant anxiety of this step by ensuring the text she submits is exactly what she intended, preventing last-minute errors due to copy-pasting or hidden formatting issues.",21
147,Rebuttal Packet Archiver,"A one-click utility that automatically gathers all assets related to the rebuttal process. It creates a new, systematically named folder in Dora's Google Drive. It then saves a PDF of the reviews, a version of the 'UIST Reviews - Knoll' GDoc, a plain text file of the final rebuttal, and a link to the Overleaf project, creating a comprehensive and permanent record of the entire process for future reference.","Dora's detailed process creates many valuable but scattered documents. This tool automates the archival process, preserving institutional knowledge for her and her lab mates without requiring extra manual effort after the stressful submission is complete.",21
148,Community Decision Notifier,"A crowd-sourced, anonymous web service where authors for a specific conference track (e.g., UIST 2025) can report when they have received their final decision. The service aggregates this data into a live progress bar and timeline, showing what percentage of decisions have been released. Users can opt-in for a single email or browser notification once a critical mass of decisions (e.g., >10%) is reported.","The period after rebuttal submission is a black box filled with anxiety and compulsive checking of email and submission portals. This tool mitigates that anxiety by providing a single, reliable community signal, replacing individual stress with shared information.",21
149,Rebuttal Strategy Analyzer,"An analytical tool that provides a post-mortem report on the submitted rebuttal. It categorizes each of Dora's responses (e.g., 'Agree & Fix', 'Clarify Misunderstanding', 'Politely Disagree') and compares the overall strategy against a database of publicly available rebuttals from the same conference. It generates a summary, such as 'Your rebuttal strategy matches 82% of previously accepted papers with similar initial review scores.'","Given Dora's analytical approach, she would likely want to reflect on her process to improve for the future. This tool provides data-driven feedback on her strategic choices, turning this single experience into a learning opportunity.",21
150,Anonymous Rebuttal Contributor,"A tool that helps Dora contribute her experience to a communal knowledge base. It takes her reviews, her final rebuttal, and the eventual outcome (Accept/Reject), and uses NLP to automatically scrub all identifying information (her name, co-authors, project-specific terms). It then uploads the anonymized data to a public repository used to train better AI tools and help future students.","Dora has benefited from examples and institutional knowledge. This tool allows her to easily 'pay it forward', contributing to a virtuous cycle of community knowledge-sharing without compromising her privacy or requiring significant effort.",21
