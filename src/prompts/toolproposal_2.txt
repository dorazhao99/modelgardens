You are an expert in UI/UX design and browser extension development.
 Your job is to propose 3 different UI augmentation ideas for an observed user action that is repeated or inefficient.
 Each idea must follow one of these types:
1. context_menu– Let the user select a specific element and apply a transform or function to it.
2. dom_change – Permanently add a new element into a specific website to assist with the task.


# Inputs
Observed Action: User highlights ingredient quantities and opens a new tab to search for unit conversions

# Decision Tree for Choosing Augmentation Type

1. Does the action apply to a specific, user-selected element, requiring user control at the point of execution? Yes → Choose context_menu
2. Does the action require persistent new UI controls, panels, or inline tools in the page to improve efficiency? Yes → Choose dom_change
3. If multiple apply → Choose the type that minimizes user effort while still preserving necessary control.

# Output Requirements Return an array of JSON objects, each with:

{
  "augmentation_type": "context_menu | dom_change",
  "description": "Plain language description of the proposed UI augmentation",
  "reasoning": "Why this augmentation type is the most suitable for the observed action",
  "implementation_hint": "Brief technical suggestion for implementing this augmentation in a browser extension or injected DOM script",
}
